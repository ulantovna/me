        <p>I am Tolgonai Uzarova, born on March 27, 2005, in the Talas village of Balbal. Raised amidst mountains, my childhood was shaped by the simplicity of rural life.</p>
        <p>In a family with three little brothers, a sister, and the constant support of my parents and grandparents, I absorbed the values of my community and the basics of education.</p>
        <p>Transitioning to Talas "Meerim" High School marked a new phase, expanding my horizons and fostering personal growth. After high school, I embarked on a journey into Computer Engineering, currently pursuing my first year of bachelor's degrees.</p>
        <p>Beyond academics, my passions define my identity. Horse riding, drawing, and playing chess are my preferred activities. In quieter moments, you'll find me immersed in the world of Chinese dramas. Whether it's the intricate plotlines or the cultural richness, I find joy in escaping reality through the captivating narratives on the screen. And, of course, I am an avid lover of sleep - those precious moments of rest that rejuvenate both body and mind.</p>
